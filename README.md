# SemiLƎⱯNear 2024

Welcome participants and voyeurs! This is the official repository for the SemiLƎⱯNear, taking place 12. - 15. September 2024 in Burg Liebenzell.

For the participants who want to dive right in: the folder Semileanear2024 is set to contain several subfolders (corresponding to your individual projects) as well as a master.lean file.

## Instructions for getting started

Required is an installation of LƎⱯN. See [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).

Follow the directions under ["Working on an existing project"](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html), but replace the URL in the `git clone` step with the one of this repository (https://github.com/PSchwahn/semileanear2024).
